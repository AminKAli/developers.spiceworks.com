#Meet Spiceworks: Where IT goes to work.

##First things first: what is Spiceworks?
Spiceworks helps IT pros tackle their IT day with a single integrated desktop app that gives them the tools they need to support their company’s employees.
Spiceworks is a free Windows application written in Ruby on Rails that provides the following services on one platform:
- Network Inventory: provides network inventory and monitoring of all the devices on the network by discovering IP-addressable devices. It can be configured to provide custom alerts and
notifications based on various criteria.
- Help Desk: provides a ticketing system, a user portal, an integrated knowledge base, and mobile ticket management features.
- Mobile Device Management: includes inventory and monitoring of mobile devices. Users can expand this base functionality to include premium MDM features from MaaS360 at a discounted Spiceworks-only price. Spiceworks also has companion apps on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spiceworks" target="_blank">Android phones or tablets</a> as well as on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spiceworks/id420457472?mt=8" target="_blank">Apple iPhone & iPad</a>.

##Who uses Spiceworks?
IT pros are the lifeblood of companies large and small who run on technology and need to keep IT up and running where they work. From the system administrator at a big manufacturing company to the help desk manager at a community college -- if they’re responsible for installing and maintaining information technologies, they can use Spiceworks to simplify their IT day.

##How do IT pros use the Spiceworks app?
IT pros use Spiceworks to manage their network inventory, including devices, software, and even cloud services (Dropbox, Google Apps, etc.). Spiceworks also helps IT pros monitor their network so they can catch problems on critical systems before their users are affected. They also use it to manage their IT help desk, from tickets, to work flow organization, to knowledge base management.

##A community 6 million strong…
On top of the Spiceworks desktop app, SpiceHeads (what Spiceworks users have come to call themselves) also use the Spiceworks Community to help them do their job. The <a href="http://community.spiceworks.com" target="_blank">Spiceworks Community</a> hosts thousands of conversations every day, giving IT pros a place to trade tech tips, show off their awesome projects, share real-world advice from the IT trenches… and have a laugh.
