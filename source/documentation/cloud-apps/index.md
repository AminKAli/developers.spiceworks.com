# What is a Cloud App?

Cloud Apps allow you to get your application in front of IT pros right from within Spiceworks.  Building a Cloud App lets your content appear inside of Spiceworks applications and it gives you the ability to integrate your app with the core Spiceworks experience through the [Cloud App APIs][Cloud APIs Link].

Cloud Apps are built on top of web technologies, so it's easy to get started or to integrate your existing web application.

# App Cards

Apps are made up of a collection of web pages that we refer to as **Cards**.  A card is a blank canvas that appears in a specific location inside of Spiceworks where your app can display content.

Some example card locations throughout the Spiceworks Desktop:

You populate a card by providing a URL that contains HTML, JavaScript and CSS.  When your card is loaded inside of Spiceworks, we load the URL within an `iframe` on that page.  All cards have access to the [Cloud App APIs][Cloud APIs Link], which provide a secure way for your web app to communicate with Spiceworks from inside of the `iframe`.

## Full Page Cards

One important example of a Cloud App card, is the **Full Page Card**.  A Full Page Card renders your application inside of its own page within Spiceworks.

All Cloud Apps must have a Full Page Card.  This is the card that will be rendered when your App is launched from other locations inside of Spiceworks.

Here's an example of what a Full Page Card looks like inside of the Spiceworks Desktop:

By default, the Full Page Card frame is full-width (ranging from 710-935px) and the full browser height.

**Note:** Currently, the Spiceworks Desktop only supports Full Page Cards.  Over time we will be expanding the locations of Cloud App cards throughout Spiceworks.
