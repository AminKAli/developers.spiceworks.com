With a user base spanning almost every country on Earth, it would take all our time to create separate language versions of Spiceworks. Plus, as smart as some of us are, I'm pretty sure we're not going to be able to speak every language out there. That's where you come in. Language packs are our method of translating Spiceworks. With a language pack, you can find or create your own translation to cover any type of regional dialect you want.

### Creating A Language Pack
For those go-getters out there who can speak multiple languages, creating a new language pack is easy:

* Navigate to **Settings &rarr; Advanced & International Options**.
* Scroll down and click **Create a new Language Pack** in the Language Pack Extensions section.
* Choose a name (the name of the language will suffice here), a description, and select the locale. Notice that the languages under locale are listed by a prefix of how that language would be written natively; i.e. Spanish is listed as "es - Spanish". Then click **Save**.
* Click **edit** next to the newly created language pack.
* Now the fun part. Click on a section to begin translating the phrases in that area. Notice the Key in the top right corner of the page to alert you of sections that are complete, incomplete, and not started.
* Be sure to save often. (We don't have to tell IT pros this, I'm sure, but better safe than sorry.)
* When you're finished, or need a break, click **Save**.

### Sharing A Language Pack
Now that you've done the hard part, share your hard work and spare someone else the trouble.

* Navigate to **Settings &rarr; Advanced & International Options**.
* Scroll down to the Language Pack Extensions section.
* Find the Language Pack you created and click **share** next to it.
* In the window that pops up, read the Extension Upload Terms and Conditions, click the box to accept them and click **Share**.

### Installing A Language Pack
If someone else has already created a language pack, there's no need to do it again, right?

* Navigate to **Settings &rarr; Advanced & International Options**.
* Scroll down to International Settings and find the "Locale:" field.
* Click **Browse Language Packs** next to the drop-down menu.
* Find the language pack you want to install and click it to go to its details page.
* Click on the **Install** button to install that language pack into your Spiceworks Desktop.
   * **NOTE:** If the **Install** button is grayed out and won't let you click it, make sure you entered the Extension Center through your Spiceworks Desktop. If you just navigate to the Community without coming from your Spiceworks application, you will not be able to install extensions.

### Enabling A Language Pack
Now that you've got your language pack installed, it's time to change the language Spiceworks speaks.

* Navigate to **Settings &rarr; Advanced & International Options**.
* Scroll down to International Settings, click the drop-down arrow next to "Locale" and select the name of your language pack from the drop-down menu. Then click **Save**.

### Editing A Language Pack
There are many different dialects of languages out there, so if the one you downloaded isn't quite right, or if you've even just found a spelling error, it's much easier to fix the language pack you have than to make a new one from scratch.

* Navigate to **Settings &rarr; Advanced & International Options**.
* Scroll down to Language Pack Extensions and find the language pack you need to edit.
* Click **source** next to the language pack in question.
* From here, you just need to find the text fields you want to edit, make your changes, then click **Save**.
