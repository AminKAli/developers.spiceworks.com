###Exporting A Report

You can easily export any Spiceworks report for sharing with the community or for backup purposes.

**To export a report:**

* Click **Reporting** under any of the navigation drop-downs.
* Find the report you'd like to export in the report table, hover over the arrow to the right of it and select **export**
* Save the report somewhere safe (make sure to leave the .rptx extension to aid in importing at a later time).


###Importing A Report

You can easily import a report into Spiceworks if you need to restore a backup report or shared community report.

**To import a report:**

* Click **Reporting** under any of the navigation drop-downs.
* Click the **Import Report** button in the toolbar.
* Use the **Browse** button to find the file to import. It should have a .rptx extension.
* Click the **OK** button and a new report will be added to your report table. Depending on the type of report, it may take a while to import.

Note: If the imported report contains custom attributes which are not defined in your Spiceworks, then those custom attributes will be created.
