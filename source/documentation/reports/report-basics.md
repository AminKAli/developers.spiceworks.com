###Accessing Reports

There are two levels of access when it come to reports in Spiceworks.  There is Admin access and Reporting access.  You can designate reporting access to anyone who might regularly need reports.  A convenient way to save yourself a little work.

* **Admin access:** This is the normal level of access that you have as the administrator of Spiceworks.  You have complete control over all reporting functions, including granting "Reporting" access to others.

* **Reporting access:** People with reporting access are allowed to open Spiceworks and run reports designated "public".  Reporting users cannot create their own reports nor access any other Spiceworks features. See [Users](http://community.spiceworks.com/help/Managing_Users) to learn how to grant reporting access.


###Running A Report
You'll be amazed at how easy Spiceworks has made it to run reports, whether you're a user with 'Admin' access or 'Reporting' access.  

**To run a report if you have 'Admin' access:**

* Click **Reporting** under any of the navigation drop-downs.
* Click on the report you'd like to run in the report table.  

**To run a report if you have 'Reporting' access:**

* Log-in to the Spiceworks desktop.
* You will be taken directly to a web page designed for users with reporting access to run 'public' reports.

* Click on a report in the table.
* Click column headings to sort the report information.
* Click the **Print**, **PDF**, **CSV** or **Excel** links to print or save the report in the desired format.  

**Once you are viewing the report:**
![Report Export Options](http://community.spiceworks.com/wiki_attachments/reportexportoptions.png){: style="float:right;"}

* Click column headings to sort the report information.
* Click the **Print** link, or hover your mouse over **Export** and select **PDF**, **CSV** or **XLS** links to print or save the report in the desired format.
* When saving a report to Excel, you must open the document with Microsoft Office 2003 or later. If you are using _Open Office_, you should try saving as a .CSV file and then importing it.  If you are using Microsoft Office 2003 or later and exporting to Excel still doesn't seem to work, you can [send Spiceworks your log files](http://community.spiceworks.com/help/How_Do_I_Send_Spiceworks_My_Log_Files%3F) and we'll try to help.

###Creating A Custom Report
As much as Spiceworks tries to anticipate your needs, sometimes you want a report run on something we never would've guessed.  Don't worry, though.  You can create custom reports to gather the data you need.

**To create a custom report:**
![Report Creation](http://community.spiceworks.com/wiki_attachments/newreport.png){: style="float:right;"}

* Click **Reporting** under any of the navigation drop-downs.
* Click the **New Report** button.
* You will be taken to the **Report Details'** page where you can enter the following:
    * The report name
    * The report description
    * Whether or not you want to make the report public
    * The report type
    * What to include in report
    * What columns to display
    * For a detailed description of each of these fields, please see below.
* Click **Save** or **Save and Run**.

**Name**
This is the name that will appear in the name column of the Reports Table.

**Description**
This is the description that will appear in the description column of the Reports Table.

**Public**
Check this box if you want to make the report available to Reporting users.

**Report type**
Choose between Devices, Tickets, Applications, Vendors/Services, People and Purchases.


**What to include in report**
This section is the heart of your search criteria. It will dictate what rows are displayed in your report.

* Identify what type of entity you're searching for (devices, tickets or applications).

* Indicate whether 'any' or 'all' search criteria must be true to be included in the report.

* Enter what you're searching for (your 'search criteria'). You can specify more than one search criteria by selecting the **Add** button just below the list of search criteria. Each data field is driven by selections made up to that point. You will always be given a list box with relevant choices based on selections you've already made.

**Columns to display**
This section allows you to essentially 'format' your report. You can add, remove, or rearrange columns. Spiceworks will select a default set of columns to be included in the report automatically depending on what type of entity you're searching for (devices, tickets, or applications).

* You can remove any column by clicking 'x' in the column heading.

* You can rearrange the columns by dragging/dropping the column to a new location.

* You can add new columns by selecting a column heading from the drop-down list and clicking the **Add** button. The drop-down list only shows column headings that are not already selected and are relevant for the entity type you're searching for (devices, tickets, or applications).
