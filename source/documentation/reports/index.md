###Overview
End of month. End of quarter. End of year. It's all the same. Somebody wants one of those pesky reports. What software is installed in our network? I need a list of all our hardware assets. How much disk space are we using? And you're left scrambling to make it happen. Not anymore.

###Why Should I Use Reports?
Are you tired of being asked the same questions by the same people? Well now, with just a few clicks, you can have a report ready to hand them, or even better, you can give them reporting access to Spiceworks and let them answer their questions themselves.


* **Answer common questions easily.** There are some questions that we know you are going to be asked so we've gone ahead and included several report options out-of-the-box.  But we know that there's going to be that guy who asks for some strange report, so we've given you the ability to generate a report for almost anything.

* **Make a good impression.** You can reply to a question from your boss with a fancy report either printed out or as a PDF, CSV, or Excel file.  Or you can show off one of your more slick reports to the Spiceworks Community by sharing it through the Extensions Center.

* **Allow people to print their own reports** Get yourself out of the loop and grant certain people "reporting access".  Now the office administrator can print a report to determine which printers need new toner, or accounting can print reports for themselves on their own.


###What Can I Do With Reports?
From the 'Reports' tab you can:

* **Access Set access to reports** Allow others to access Spiceworks to only run reports

* **Export Export a report.** Allows you to create a backup of a report or share it with others

* **Time Use "time worked" in reports.** Add fields to your reports to show the time that you or your fellow admins have spent working tickets

* **Tricks Some reporting tricks and examples.**Report on devices that _don't_ have certain software installed or use relative dates (last week, today, etc.)
